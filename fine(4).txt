Steps for Oracle Installation and Performing DBMS Practical no. 4

	1) Install Oracle for Windows by using the following link : 
https://www.oracle.com/in/database/technologies/xe-downloads.html 

	2) Then Complete the Installation Process.
	
	3) Once Installation is done, Just search for SQL plus in your PC and open it. 
	
	4) Enter user-name as system and password which you set while doing installation process.
	
	5) Create two tables named Borrower and fine.
	
	set SERVEROUTPUT on;
	 CREATE TABLE Borrower (
	         Roll_no NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
	         Name VARCHAR2(100),
	         Date_of_Issue DATE,
	         Name_of_Book VARCHAR2(100),
	         Status CHAR(1) 
	     );
	
	     CREATE TABLE Fine (
	         Roll_no NUMBER,
	         FineDate DATE,
	         Amt NUMBER(10,2)
	       );
	     
	
	6) Insert values into Borrower table only.
Ex : INSERT INTO Borrower VALUES (1, 'Aditya', TO_DATE('2024-09-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'The Secret', 'I');
(Note :- Status should only contain 'I' or 'R' , 'I' means Book is Issued and 'R' means Book is returned.)
  (Don't insert anything into fine table).

	7) Minimize the SQL plus and Open the Notepad
	
	8) Then Create a text document and copy paste the code( which I have sent below in file named 'fine'). 
	(Note : Save the file with the extension .sql).
	
	9) Now, open the SQL plus and Write this command SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
	
	10) Then write the path of the file in which code is written @path_to_your_file\file_name.sql  
	Ex: @C:\Users\Aditya\Desktop\fine.sql  
	(Note :Don't forget the @ symbol before the path)
	
	11) Once the Procedure is created , Then write this command  
	EXEC CalculateFine ( roll_no, 'name of book'); 
	(Note : Enter the actual roll.no and name of book which you inserted into Borrower Table).
	
	12) You are done, now to check the output just enter the command 
	SELECT * FROM fine;
